## Architecture · how the six agents work

This connector runs a strict six-agent pipeline locally on your machine:

| Agent | What it does | Output |
|---|---|---|
| **Reader** | Reads every input document. Extracts facts with per-document audit log. **Applies the pseudonymisation firewall** (see below). Halts if a required statute PDF is missing. | `case-facts.md` |
| **Format** | Loads the case-type-specific skill + bench/state/forum-config + pleading base. Maps Reader's facts into the format placeholders. | `format-shell.md` |
| **Drafter** | Writes the first complete draft — Cause Title, Statutory Opening, Synopsis, Statement of Facts, Grounds, Prayer, Verification, Counsel Block, Index, Annexure List. | `draft-v1.md` + `draft-v1.docx` |
| **Verifier** | Anti-hallucination firewall. Compares draft-v1 against case-facts.md fact-by-fact. Flags hallucinated dates, fabricated citations, unsupported assertions, orphan annexure markers, missing factual basis. | `verification-report.md` |
| **Refiner** | Applies every Verifier flag. Polishes language to formal Indian pleading register. Enforces Registry formatting. Strips AI-style markers. | `draft-v2.md` + `draft-v2.docx` |
| **Overseer** | Reads draft-v2 with opposing-counsel lens. Finds weak prayers, contradictory facts, attackable defects, missing limbs of argument. Suggests hardening. | `opposing-notes.md` + `final-draft.docx` |

The pipeline is **forced by the connector itself** — the `get_agent_instructions()` tool is the mandatory first call when you ask for a draft and returns an 11-step orchestration script that names every agent's tool call. The Drafter cannot legitimately produce final output without the Reader having saved `case-facts.md` first. The `save_artifact` tool's allow-list rejects standalone python-docx or JavaScript generator scripts.

## 🔒 Pseudonymisation gateway — what gets substituted

The Reader agent applies a privacy firewall **before any downstream agent sees the facts**. The following are substituted with structural placeholders:

- **Party identifiers** — Petitioner / Respondent / Plaintiff / Defendant / Accused / Complainant / Witness names → `[Petitioner-A]`, `[Respondent-B]`, `[Witness-A]`
- **Addresses** — Full residential / business addresses → `[Address-Placeholder]`
- **Government identifiers** — PAN, Aadhaar, TAN, DIN, GSTIN → `[PAN-Placeholder]`, `[Aadhaar-Placeholder]`, etc.
- **Case numbers** — FIR / CR / Crime / SLP / Diary / CC / SC / RCS / lower-court case numbers → `[Crime-No-Placeholder]`, `[SLP-No-Placeholder]`, `[Lower-Court-Case-No-Placeholder]`
- **Financial figures** — Amounts in dispute, compensation, tax assessed → `[Amount-Placeholder]`
- **Statutory notice references** — Section 106 TPA notice dates, statutory demand-notice dates → `[Notice-Date-Placeholder]`

The Drafter, Verifier, Refiner, and Overseer agents process **placeholders only**. At the final `save_draft_as_docx` step, the placeholders are re-substituted with the real values **on your local machine**. The LLM never sees the re-substituted output.

This is the connector's contribution to your **Section 8(5) DPDP Act 2023** safeguard.

## ⚖️ DPDP Act 2023 — what this means for you

**Publisher position.** wolfgang_rush, in its capacity as software publisher, is **neither a Data Fiduciary nor a Data Processor** under the DPDP Act 2023 in respect of this connector. The connector runs entirely on your machine. There is no wolfgang_rush server, no telemetry, no API endpoint that the publisher controls. Section 2(i) requires "determining purpose and means of processing" — wolfgang_rush determines neither.

**User position.** You — the advocate using this connector — are the **Data Fiduciary** for your own client's personal data. This was true before installing the connector and remains true after. Your obligations under Sections 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13 of the DPDP Act 2023 continue independent of this connector.

**What the connector helps with.** The pseudonymisation gateway is an architectural safeguard within the meaning of Section 8(5) (reasonable security safeguards). Local-only processing supports your minimisation posture (Section 8). The Reader's per-document audit log supports Section 8(8) (data accuracy). The Section 17(2)(a) exemption ("personal data processed for the purposes of any legal proceeding") substantially covers most everyday advocate processing.

**What the connector does not do.** It does not, by itself, satisfy any DPDP notice / consent / grievance-redressal obligation. Those remain yours to operationalise. It does not cover Anthropic's position as the LLM operator — that is governed by Anthropic's own terms.

## ⚠️ AI verification disclaimer · 🔒 Pseudonymisation procedure

> **⚠️ AI can make mistakes — please verify the information before filing.**
> Every draft produced by this connector is a STARTING POINT. The Verifier
> agent runs an anti-hallucination firewall and the Overseer agent runs an
> opposing-counsel review, but neither replaces an advocate's independent
> verification of statutory references, citation accuracy, factual fidelity,
> and Registry-formatting compliance with the user's High Court / forum.
> The advocate filing the pleading remains responsible for the contents.
>
> **🔒 Protected by pseudonymisation procedure.** The Reader agent applies a
> domain-specific privacy firewall as the first step of the pipeline — party
> names, addresses, identifying numbers (FIR / CR / Crime / Suit / Diary /
> SLP / lower-court case numbers), PAN / Aadhaar references, financial
> figures, witness names, and statutory-notice references are substituted
> with structural placeholders BEFORE any downstream agent sees the facts.
> The Drafter, Verifier, Refiner, and Overseer agents process placeholders
> only. Real values are re-substituted at the final docx render step on the
> user's local machine. No real identifying data leaves the case folder.

## Examples

Three example prompts that demonstrate core functionality. Full prompt text with expected tool sequence is in `SAMPLE-CASES/README.md`.

- *"Draft a CIT(A) Form 35 appeal challenging a Section 143(3) assessment order."*
- *"Draft an ITAT Form 36 appeal challenging a CIT(A) order."*
- *"Draft a Section 148A objection to a reopening notice."*

See `SAMPLE-CASES/README.md` for the full prompt text and the expected tool-call sequence the Anthropic reviewer can use to exercise the pipeline end-to-end.
