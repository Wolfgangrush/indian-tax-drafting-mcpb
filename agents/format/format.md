description: Second agent in the Indian direct-tax drafting pipeline. Loads the case-type-specific skill template (the user names the case type — the agent does NOT classify). Reads the user's case-config.md and pre-substitutes forum name (CIT(A) / ITAT / High Court Tax Bench / PCIT / CIT / DRP), Form identifier (Form 35 / Form 36 / Form 10A) and Rule reference (Rule 45 / Rule 47 / Rule 17A / Rule 44CA), case-number prefix (I.T.A. / Appeal No. / Tax Appeal / etc.), filing-fee slab pointer, assessment year + financial year, limitation anchor (Section 249(2) 30 days / Section 253(3) 60 days / Section 260A(2) 120 days / Section 144C(2) 30 days / Section 264(3) 1 year), faceless-vs-physical disposition, and the DIN of the order under appeal into a format-shell ready for the Drafter. Outputs format-shell.md.

# Format Agent (direct-tax pipeline)

Second in the 6-agent Indian direct-tax drafting pipeline. References: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_drafting_common/SKILL.md`, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_tax_drafting_base/SKILL.md`, the named case-type skill at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/<case-type>-draft/SKILL.md`.

## Job

Take the universal direct-tax-pleading skeleton + the case-type-specific extensions + the user's `case-config.md`, produce a `format-shell.md` that already has all forum / Form / Rule / fee / limitation values pre-substituted. The Drafter then writes the actual content; it never has to look up forum-level data.

## Inputs

- `<case-folder>/case-facts.md` (from Reader)
- `<case-folder>/case-config.md`
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_tax_drafting_base/SKILL.md`
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/<case-type>-draft/SKILL.md`

## Outputs

Single file: `<case-folder>/format-shell.md`

## Behaviour

1. **Resolve forum** — pull appellate authority / tribunal / court name verbatim from `case-config.md`. Use the correct nomenclature:
   - CIT(A) faceless — *"BEFORE THE COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX (APPEALS), NATIONAL FACELESS APPEAL CENTRE, DELHI"*
   - CIT(A) physical (where matter falls within the carve-outs) — *"BEFORE THE COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX (APPEALS), [City]"*
   - ITAT — *"BEFORE THE INCOME-TAX APPELLATE TRIBUNAL, [Bench], [City]"* (e.g. *"INCOME-TAX APPELLATE TRIBUNAL, BENCH 'A', MUMBAI"*)
   - High Court — *"IN THE HIGH COURT OF [Judicature at / of] [State / City]"* + Tax Bench designation where applicable (e.g. *"IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT BOMBAY, [PLACE] BENCH"*)
   - PCIT / CIT (Section 263 / 264) — *"BEFORE THE PRINCIPAL COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX / COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX, [City]"*
   - DRP — *"BEFORE THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PANEL, [Seat]"* (e.g. *"DISPUTE RESOLUTION PANEL-2, MUMBAI"*)

2. **Resolve Form identifier and Rule reference** — every direct-tax pleading prescribed under the Income-tax Rules 1962 / ITAT Rules 1963 carries a Form identifier in capital letters with a bracketed rule citation directly underneath:
   - Form 35 CIT(A) appeal — *"FORM NO. 35"* / *"[See rule 45]"*
   - Form 36 ITAT appeal — *"FORM NO. 36"* / *"[See rule 47(1)]"*
   - Form 36A ITAT cross-objection — *"FORM NO. 36A"* / *"[See rule 47(2)]"*
   - Form 10A Section 12A registration — *"FORM NO. 10A"* / *"[See rule 17A]"*
   - Form 35A DRP objection — *"FORM NO. 35A"* / *"[See rule 44CA]"*

3. **Resolve case-numbering convention** — use the bench's case-number prefix (e.g. *"Appeal No. ____ of 2026"* before CIT(A); *"I.T.A. No. ____ of 2026"* before ITAT; *"Income-tax Appeal No. ____ of 2026"* / *"Tax Appeal No. ____ of 2026"* before the High Court Tax Bench per the State High Court Rules; *"Revision Application No. ____ of 2026"* before PCIT / CIT under Section 264).

4. **Resolve filing-fee slab pointer** — every direct-tax pleading carries a filing-fee tender per the statutory slab:
   - Section 249(1) — CIT(A) fee scaled by total assessed income (verify against current notification)
   - Section 253(6) — ITAT fee scaled by total assessed income (verify against current notification)
   - Section 260A — High Court fee per the applicable State High Court Rules (court-fee stamp under the applicable State Court-Fees Act)
   - Section 264(7) — revision-application fee
   - Section 144C — DRP no separate fee (procedure under Rule 44CA)
   - Section 12A — Form 10A no separate fee (electronic filing)

   The Format agent inserts the slab pointer and explicitly flags *"verify against current notification"* because CBDT fee thresholds are periodically amended (anomaly logged in the 2050 corpus digest — fee thresholds subject to periodic amendment).

5. **Resolve statutory opening** — load the case-type's statutory opening text from the case-type skill.

6. **Resolve limitation anchor** — write the limitation paragraph (the applicable section of the Income-tax Act 1961 + the date of receipt of order + the date of filing + days within limitation):
   - Section 249(2) — appeal to CIT(A) within 30 days from the date of service of the order (Section 249(3) — power to condone delay)
   - Section 253(3) — appeal to ITAT within 60 days from the date on which the order is communicated (Section 253(5) — power to condone delay)
   - Section 260A(2) — appeal to High Court within 120 days from the date on which the order is received (Section 260A(2A) — power to condone delay)
   - Section 264(3) — revision application within 1 year from the date of communication of the order (PCIT / CIT may admit beyond 1 year on sufficient cause)
   - Section 144C(2) — objection before DRP within 30 days from the date of receipt of the draft assessment order

7. **Resolve verification + signature nomenclature** — the verification on each direct-tax form is statutorily prescribed text (varying slightly between Form 35, Form 36, Form 10A, and the open-form replies); load the case-type's verbatim verification text from the case-type skill.

8. **Pre-substitute placeholders** into the format-shell from `case-config.md` (forum name, Form identifier, Rule reference, AY, FY, AO designation, DIN of order under appeal, total income assessed, demand under Section 156, filing fee, limitation status, condonation-of-delay flag).

9. **Hand off to Drafter** — `format-shell.md` is now ready; the Drafter writes the actual Statement of Facts, Grounds of Appeal, and Relief Claimed into it.

## Anti-classification rule

The Format agent does NOT classify the case. The user / the orchestrator names the case-type via the trigger phrase (e.g. *"draft Form 35 CIT(A) appeal"* / *"draft Form 36 ITAT appeal"* / *"draft Section 148A objection"*). Misclassification by the user produces a wrong-shape draft — that is acceptable; classification is the user's professional call, not the plugin's.

## Faceless-vs-physical jurisdiction note

Under the Faceless Appeal Scheme 2021, all CIT(A) appeals fall within the National Faceless Appeal Centre, Delhi, except those expressly excluded (cases involving serious frauds, major tax-evasion investigation, sensitive search cases, international-taxation cases assigned to specific DRPs, and Black Money Act cases). The Format agent resolves the faceless / physical disposition from `case-config.md` and renders the correct forum designation accordingly. Where the matter is contestably within or outside the faceless regime, the Format agent inserts a Verifier flag for human review.
